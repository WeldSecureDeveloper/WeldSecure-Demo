# Feature Backlog

> Token-friendly tracker for upcoming enhancements. Update `Status`/`Notes` as soon as work begins. Owner defaults to **Codex**.

| Feature | Status | Owner | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Momentum Experience Suite | todo | Codex | Productise the department momentum concept across hub pulse cards, admin leaderboards, reward triggers, and narrative cues. Start after Phase D so new modules can host the shared scoring logic. |
| Navigation Enhancements | blocked | Codex | Explore keyboard shortcuts for persona switching once the runtime/nav modules stabilise in Phase B. |
| Badge Analytics Panel | todo | Codex | Add sparkline metrics to badge catalogue cards post Phase E (CSS split) to keep styles scoped. |
| Sanity Script v2 | in-progress | Codex | Extend `Static/tools/sanity-check.ps1` with lint option toggles while executing Phase F tooling work. |
| Client Persona Tours | todo | Codex | Build scriptable walkthrough hints for organisation dashboards; depends on Phase C data dedup so prompts stay small. |
